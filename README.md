# SteamID64 Grabber

This is a simple webapp that I made as a fun little side-project.

I made this because I wanted to have a quick way to retrieve the SteamID64 from the vanity url of a steam account.

### Example:

### Features

- Get steamid64 from vanity url

- Display name of the steam account

- Display the date of profile creation

- Display the country code of the steam account

- Display the profile picture of the steam account
